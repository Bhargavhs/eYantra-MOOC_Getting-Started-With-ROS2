# Sensors 



This section will cover the various sensors that can be used for perception. 

We will define sensors, and discuss the various types of sensors available for the task of perception. 

Even the best perception algorithms are limited by the quality of their sensor data. And careful selection of sensors can go a long way to simplifying the perception task.





## So what is a sensor? 

- A sensor is any device that measures or detects some property of the environment, or changes to that property over time. 

  

- Sensors are broadly categorized into two types, depending on what property they record. 

  

  - If they record a property of the environment they are **exteroceptive**. _"Extero"_ means outside, or from the surroundings. 

  

  - On the other hand, if the sensors record a property of the system itself, they are **proprioceptive**. _"Proprios"_ means internal, or one's own.
