<mark> Recommended time for completing the setup: 20-24 hrs </mark>

* In this section we are going to learn how to use ROS with MoveIt2! package to control Robotic Manipulators in Gazebo Simulator.
  

* The skill that you are going to learn in this section can be used to control real Robotic Manipulators. In fact, the code which you are going to write will be translated into actual robots.
