Welcome, cosmic explorers, to the exhilarating world of ***"Cosmo Logistic"***, the captivating theme for ***eYRC 2023-24!*** In this journey, we are taking a giant leap into the realm of inter-planetary logistics, and our stage is set in a futuristic warehouse, nestled on some X planet among the stars.

### Some Motivation  *(Ultimate goal of this theme)*

***The Cosmic Warehouse:***

Our theme unfolds within a remarkable inter-planetary warehouse, where celestial packages are meticulously sorted and prepared for their epic journeys to distant planets. Imagine a bustling warehouse where every day, packages destined for various celestial bodies are organized and dispatched.

***The Stellar Team:***
But here's where it gets truly cosmic! At the heart of this operation, a robotic arm and a mobile robot join forces as our dynamic duo. These space-age companions collaborate seamlessly to sort, pick, and prepare the packages for interstellar dispatch.

***The Cosmic Challenge:***
Your mission in this year's eYRC is to develop an algorithm that enables our robotic arm and mobile robot to autonomously sort these celestial packages to get ready for inter planet transportation. You'll harness the power of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to guide the mobile robot through the warehouse and sort and pick packages using the UR5 Robotic Arm.

***Cosmic Abilities:***
Your team will master several interstellar skills:
- *SLAM Navigation:* Chart the uncharted cosmic terrain within the warehouse as you navigate with precision, ensuring our robot knows its location at all times.
- *Package Detection:* Equip your robotic companion with the ability to spot and identify celestial packages nestled on racks.
- *Robotic Dexterity:* You'll command the robotic arm to pick and prepare these packages for their interstellar voyages.

***The Cosmic Stages:***
This celestial journey unfolds in two thrilling stages:
- *Stage 1:* Simulator Challenge: Here, you'll complete the Cosmo Logistic theme in a simulated cosmic environment, honing your skills and fine-tuning your algorithms before heading towards making any collisions with real robots ;)
- *Stage 2:* Real-World Cosmic Conquest: The climax of our journey awaits in the "Real" warehouse at IIT Bombay, where you'll gain remote access to "Real" hardware. This is where your celestial skills will be put to the ultimate test as you navigate the cosmic warehouse and sort packages in the physical realm.
