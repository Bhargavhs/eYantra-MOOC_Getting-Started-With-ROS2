* `root` is the beginning or the top point of the Unix File System under which directories important to a Unix OS resides. It is different from a root user of the system.

  

* Each directory contains set of files and programs which are required for the proper functioning of the OS.

  

* Out of all the directories, `/home/` and `/opt/` are two important directories for this eYRC Theme.

  

* `/opt/` is the directory or folder where the packages or software which you are going to install using package manager (`apt-get` in Ubuntu) is going to reside.

  

* `/home/` is the folder where all your personal files including project files is going to reside.
