In this theme as well as other projects that one would do in the domain of Robotics, one will use ROS and Python Programming. Therefore it's a good idea to spend some time learning and familiarizing yourself with the aforementioned.

If you are not convinced of the awesomeness of ROS, here is a video worth watching!

> ***Important Note***: 
> * ***NOT all of the resources is needed for Task 0.***
> * ***These are resources for ROS 2 as a whole and not specifically for this theme or task.***
> * So feel free to scan and read only what is needed for the Task ***OR*** you could familiarise yourself with the complete resources for *ROS 2* right away so you'll be better equipped for future tasks and other projects you may want to work on, in the future.
> * Alternatively you could also refer to [*ROS 2 Humble Documentation*](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html) directly to learn *ROS 2*
