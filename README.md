> *Welcome to the exciting world of ROS2! This comprehensive introductory course is designed for both newcomers to the Robot Operating System (ROS) and experienced ROS1 users looking to transition to the latest version. Whether you are just starting your journey with ROS or looking to upgrade your skills, this course will provide you with the foundational knowledge you need to succeed.*


### Why ROS2?

ROS2 brings a host of new features and improvements that enhance performance, flexibility, and scalability. These advancements are poised to drive the future of robotics, making ROS2 a must-learn for anyone serious about robotics development.

### What You'll Learn

In this course, you will:

- **Understand the Basics:** Get a solid grasp of the core concepts and architecture of ROS2.

- **Hands-On Practice:** Engage in practical exercises and debugging techniques that reinforce your learning and build your skills.

- **ROS1 v/s ROS2 and DDS:** Learn the key differences between ROS1 and ROS2; Recognize the features of Data Distribution Service (DDS) used in ROS2

- **Future-Proof Skills:** Equip yourself with the knowledge and skills that are set to become industry standards in the coming years.

### Pre-requisites:

- Knowledge in `C++` and/or `Python` Programming languages

- Familiarity with `ROS1` (recommended, but not compulsory)

- Basic understanding of `Linux - Ubuntu` Operating System
