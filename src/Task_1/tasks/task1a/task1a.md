    <h1>Task 1A - Object Pose Estimation</h1>
</center>

---

### Task Objective:
*Pose estimation of package box using Aruco detection:*
You will be given an ur5 robotic arm model with a warehouse having multiple racks and package boxes placed. Your mission is to locate package box position using computer vision. These boxes are placed on racks and you have to selectively choose boxes which are in reach of robot arm. So, move ahead towards *[task instructions](./instructions.md)* to prepare your workspace and get your robot ready for its first arm movement.

As we have different aruco markers placed on each package box in the warehouse. In this task, you have to detect package box using aruco detection and estimate their pose using OpenCV library. Finally, publishing a transform between aruco center position of package box and base_link of robot arm which can be visualised in RViz. 

You will be learning more about the concepts of computer vision and some logical maths to refresh your mind (unless you like maths ; )
