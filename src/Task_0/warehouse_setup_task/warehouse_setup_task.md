## Step into the cosmos, intrepid explorers of eYRC 2023-24! ðŸš€âœ¨

Welcome to Task 0, the launchpad for the *Cosmo Logistic Bot's* celestial journey through the stars. Here, we're all about setting up the basics - ***Ubuntu and ROS***, the essential tools that power our space-faring robots.

But don't be surprised if a few asteroids cross your path - we call them "*errors*". If something doesn't quite go as planned, don't panic! Think of it as solving a puzzle.

So, fellow space travellers, buckle up! The adventure begins with Task 0. Embrace the journey, because every problem you solve brings you one step closer to the finals of e-Yantra Robotics Competition.


### Task Objective:
*Robot Unboxing Ceremony:*
In this task, you won't be creating a robot from scratch. Instead, you will be given a mobile robot model. Your mission is to unbox and prepare it for further tasks. So, move ahead towards *[task instructions](task_instruction.md)* to prepare your workspace and get your robot ready for its grand interstellar debut.
