    <h1>Python Coding Contest</h1>
</center>


In this task, you will apply the primary usage of Python language learnt from the Tutorials.

This task is a little different, in a way that it's actually a **team-contest** hosted on <b><a href="https://www.codechef.com" target="_blank">CodeChef</a></b>.

What's ***CodeChef*** you ask?

CodeChef is a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming" target="_blank">competitive programming</a> platform. It is an educational initiative by Unacademy that hosts many coding contests and has a large community of programmers that helps students and professionals test and improve their coding skills.

## Team-Contest Description

We will be using this platform to test and enhance your **Python** programming skills.

- The contest will start from ***5-09-2023 20:00:00 IST*** and will end on ***01-10-2023 23:59:00 IST***.
- The contest will have **10 Python problems**; we will be using only Python 3.
- **Each problem** has the maximum score of **100 points**.
- **Problem** could be divided into multiple **sub-tasks**, and the *100 points* are distributed over these sub-tasks. The points awarded for each sub-task will be mentioned in the description of that problem.
- **Each sub-task** will have few **test cases** associated with it.
- To obtain all the points associated with a **sub-task**, your program will have to clear or pass all the test cases. Failing even **one test case**, will result in **0 points** for that particular sub-task.
- Your performance in this contest will contribute to the overall score of **Task 0**.


Now that you are aware of the overall contest structure, let’s zoom in on the structure each problem will follow.

1. **Problem**: A brief description of the problem statement. Read this very carefully.
2. **Input**: It describes the format in which the input to a program will be provided.
3. **Output**: It describes the format and output of a program you *must* follow.
4. **Constraints**: As the name suggests, it will tell you the limits/range of values a variable will have.
5. **Sub-task**: This section will mention all the sub-tasks and the points associated with each sub-task.
6. **Sample Input**: It shows an example input to a program, based on its format mentioned in *Input* section above.
7. **Sample Output**: It shows an example output of a program for the corresponding *Sample Input* based on its format mentioned in *Output* section above.
8. **Explanation**: This section explains the problem using the *Sample Input* and *Sample Output* as a reference.


Given all the above details, one might wonder how to feed the input values of test cases to the code? You need not worry about that. Just assume there is a user at the other end who is inserting the input to your program. You just have to read and parse the values.

Also, to test your solution, you may copy-paste the *Sample Input* from each problem on the main page, into the IDE console (ensure that the Custom Input box is checked on for this).


***A word of caution:***

*While displaying the results, make sure you display it in the exact format as is specified in the problem. For example, **an extra space, capitals** etc. in the output can cause the code to fail the test case.*


Here’s a list of possible remarks for the output you might get. You can also find this list on the right bottom corner of the problem page.

## How do I access the Team-Contest?

- Head over to <b><a href="https://www.codechef.com" target="_blank">CodeChef</a></b> and create an account using the same **email address** that you used to register on the eYRC portal. If you have already have a CodeChef account, simply log in to your account. *Please make sure you use the same email address that you used while registering for eYRC*.

- Once you have created / logged into your CodeChef account, click on this link: <b><a href="https://www.codechef.com/EYRC2023" target="_blank">Team-Contest Page</a></b>.

- To participate, you MUST create a team with the **Team Login ID** name as **`ThemeName_<Team-ID>`**. So, if your Theme is LD and **Team ID** is ***999***, you will create the team named as ***ld_0999***.

- In order to avoid duplicate teams, it is recommended that **only the team leader** creates the team and sends invite to other members of the team.

- A student can be part of **only one** team, the one with which they registered for eYRC. 

- - **DO NOT** change team compositions at this stage. 
  - **NO** participant should be part of more than one team.
  - Students **not abiding** by this rule will result in all the team members getting **disqualified** from the competition.

- Once you have formed the team, you can enter the contest here: <b><a href="https://www.codechef.com/EYRC2023" target="_blank">Team-Contest Page</a></b>.
- You will find the list of **10 problems**. Clicking on one of these problems will lead you to the problem page where you will find all the details of that particular problem.
- All that's left now, is to start solving the problem and submit your solution.<br/>

***Just a suggestion***

*Try to explore CodeChef and get yourself acquainted with the platform before you begin with the contest. CodeChef supports many languages. You could try attempting the practice problems ( in Python 3) hosted on CodeChef.*
